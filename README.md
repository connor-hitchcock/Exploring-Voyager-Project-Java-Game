# Exploring-Voyager-Project-SENG201
Within this repo is the source code for the project in SENG202, a software engineering course at the University of Canterbury. Have fun playing as an astronaut surfing through space to find all the star pieces, but make sure you don't run out of fuel. This game utilises a complex ingame physics system and an aesthetic GUI. I would highly recommend having a quick playthrough of the game. It does not take that long. 

Additionally, this was a pair project with James Kwok.
